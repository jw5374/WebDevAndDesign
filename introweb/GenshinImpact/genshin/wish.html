                The Wish system is the primary way the game monetizes itself, and is what thrusts the game into being classified as a “gacha game”. 
                The term “gacha” comes from the term<i>gachapon</i>, which are japanese capsule toys that are dispensed via vending machines which often sell them randomly to the customer. 
                Likewise, in gacha games, you can draw various items and characters via the “gacha” or “Wish” in this case, where you have a calculated chance to receive certain items of various rarities.

                <h3>Spending Money</h3>
                <p>
                    Microtransactions and gambling in the form of lootboxes etc. have been a sore point within the less casual gaming community in recent time, and although gacha games have existed for a long time in the East Asian market (particularly Japan),<i>Genshin</i>is for many, the first of game of this type they’ve encountered.
                    Consequently, there was some backlash, and another point of criticism arose. The controversy arises from this as the game is generally designed for regular, short, and daily play where many mechanics of the game (e.g. challenging Domains or fighting boss monsters for equipment and enhancement materials) are gated behind a stamina system, in this case, called<I>Resin</i>.
                    This Resin is regenerated at a rate of 8min/resin, and since much of the progress and gameplay itself require the use of this, this essentially adds a time-gate to progression.
                    This encourages players to either spend money to either obtain items, or to further challenge Resin-gated activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, players can only directly spend money on 3 things, one of which is to purchase an in-game currency called<i>Genesis Crystals</i>which can, in turn, be exchanged for one of the primary in-game currencies called<i>Primogems</i>.
                    These Primogems (gems for short) can be used for purchasing more Resin (up to 300 a day), or more commonly, as currency to exchange for Wishes in order to roll the gacha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spending this money to buy Resin can give players a slight advantage when trying to progress their characters, but even more so, many of the most powerful items/characters in the game are locked behind this Wish system, thus encouraging people to spend on it and simultaneously making regular gameplay deliberately slow and tedious in order to do so.
                    Because of this many players and critics will often deride this as a “pay-to-win” model, but although it shouldn’t be supported, it also is not impossible to fully experience the game without spending a single cent.

                <h3>Banner Mechanics</h3>
                <p>
                    Much of the updates to the game center around “Banners” for the Wish system.
                    Players can wish from 3 of these Banners: A limited promotion banner, a limited weapon banner, and the standard banner (which is the only persistent banner available at all times).
                    The limited banners last around a month, and will feature a promotion character that will either be completely new, or a previously featured promotional character.
                    The character featured often centers around characters that are either introduced or featured in the most recently released story quests for the current update cycle (around every 6 months will feature a major update).
                </p>
                <p>
                    All banners have a “pity” system.
                    The way they work differs between the character banners and the weapon banner.
                    Item rarities are broken into 3 tiers (within the gacha), with each successive tier being rarer than the next: 3 stars, 4 stars, and 5 stars.
                    Every 10 wishes there’s a guaranteed chance to receive a 4 star item, and every 90 wishes there’s a guaranteed chance to receive a 5 star item. Every other item that is not a 4 star or 5 star, will be a 3 star item.
                    The base probabilities for 4 star items are around 2.5-5%, and 5 star probability is 0.6%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focusing in on the 5 star probability (which is the cause of most players’ concerns), after around 70 wishes, the base probability increases drastically as every wish will get you closer to 100% probability at 90 wishes (the “hard pity”).
                    This internal counter is carried over even after the limited banner switches, so players can often strategize and save their wishes for certain characters that they want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Related to the pity counter, when wishing on the limited character banner, you have a 50% chance to get the promoted character.
                    If you do not receive the promoted character (you instead receive a standard banner character), then the next time you receive a character, it will have a guaranteed chance to be the promoted character.
                    This works the same whether the rarity is 4 or 5 stars, and will also carry over between banner updates.
                    This means if planned well, you can save yourself a guaranteed promotional character if your pity lines up well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with the pity system, every update cycle features various gameplay events that will reward you with free gems and other enhancement materials.
                    This allows players to reasonably save up enough of these gems to obtain even the highest rarity items, even if it’s at a slower rate (roughly every few months).
