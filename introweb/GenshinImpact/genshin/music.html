                As previously mentioned, the soundtrack of the game is composed by the<i>HOYO-MiX</i>team lead by composer Yu-peng Chen. 
                The music is available online including platforms like Apple Music and Spotify. 
                There are 7 currently released albums, 5 albums for each in-game region’s music, and 2 albums of promotional music. 
                <i>HOYO-MiX</i>has worked with the<i>London Philharmonic</i>,<i>Shanghai Symphony</i>, and<i>Tokyo Philharmonic</i>orchestras to bring players a rich musical experience in-game.

                Each major region in-game roughly draws inspiration from certain real geographical regions, Mondstadt: Germany/Europe, Liyue: China, Inazuma: Japan. For each region’s soundtrack, liberties are taken to represent them with some traditional instruments, often blending old and new very well. 
                There are currently 248 tracks in total available to players, consisting of tracks for sub-areas within regions (daytime and nighttime variations), overworld battle themes, boss themes, menu music, and character themes.

                Each region is distinct in their atmosphere not only through visuals but through this music. 
                However even so, they like to maintain a style unique to the game itself. For example, when looking at the battle tracks for the 3 major regions, one can find a consistent motif present in one track per region. 
                And variations of each track just between night and day often use similar melodies, but can tell different stories. 
                Just the main menu has 4 variations alone evoking different moods with each.

                Recently there was an online concert dedicated to the music of Genshin.
                This concert premiered on Oct 3, 2021 and featured orchestral performances as well as fan songs relating to the game.
                A live concert in China was expected to be held, but currently unknown as it was postponed.
