                <i>Genshin Impact</i>is a cross-platform action RPG “gacha” style game developed by the company<i>Mihoyo</i>(stylised:<i>miHoYo</i>). 
                Development began back in 2017 and the game was announced in 2019, holding several closed beta tests before its official release on September 28, 2020.
                This is approximately <span id="daysText"></span> days since today: <span id="currentDay"></span>.
                This coincides with the release of the company’s first game<i>FlyMe2theMoon</i>, which was released on the same day in 2011. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The game saw massive success, quickly becoming the company’s most successful game to date, and successfully justifying the high cost of development (nearly $100 million). 
                However along with the success came several controversies, with the largest initial criticism being its similarity in aesthetic to Nintendo’s latest Zelda installment: <i>Breath of the Wild</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This similarity can be seen throughout the game’s design. The color palette, especially in the game’s first 2 regions, often uses warm colors which captures a similar “idyllic” fantasy feeling. 
                Both feature cel shaded lighting evoking an “anime”-esque art style. 
                Both feature an open-world setting for exploration, where players will find puzzles, various secrets, enemies, and quests littered throughout every region. 
                The opening sequence to both games are infamously similar. 
                Mihoyo cites that BoTW was a heavy inspiration for<i>Genshin</i>and can certainly be seen with the many similarities in appearance and mechanics, thus leading to heavy criticism from global and Chinese players themselves, fearing that the game was simply a copycat in order to capitalize on the success of BoTW.

                However beyond these similarities, the games diverge into their own respective identities, with differences coming in not only just story, but in the finer details of combat, in-game events, and unfortunately the monetization. 
                <i>Genshin Impact</i>was released free for mobile, Windows, and Playstation platforms, with a microtransaction monetization model: “gacha” or the internally named “Wishing” system. 
                The gameplay features the previously mentioned open-world setting, where players can explore with up to 4 different characters at a in their party. 
                Players are able to run, swim, sail, climb and glide through the world of<i>Teyvat</i>, complemented by various character abilities which can further enhance travel and aid in puzzle solving/general exploration. 
                Combat with the various enemies in the world is defined by an elemental reaction system (7 elements: Pyro (fire), Hydro (water), Cryo (ice), Electro (electric), Anemo (air), Dendro (plants), and Geo (earth)) which players can take advantage of to induce certain effects and boost their damage. 
                These elements are also woven into the puzzles and secrets found around the regions. 
                Character abilities can be raised by enhancing equipment such as  “Artifacts” and weapons, as well as raising the level of the character, their abilities or their constellation level. “Artifacts”, weapon enhancement, and character enhancement materials completing various challenges in the form of “Domains” and open-world “Leyline blossoms”. 
                Exploration can also yield rewards in the form of weapons, Artifacts and gold (“Mora”).

                Simple gameplay will allow players to progress steadily up to a certain point. This is especially aided by the regular-game events that come with regular updates for the game. 
                But this leads into another major controversy, which is in their monetization scheme where further details can be found in the<a href="genshin/wish.html">Wishing</a>page.

            <p>
                Aside from gameplay and monetization, the game’s soundtrack also saw positive reception (and from what I’ve seen, much less controversy). 
                To date, there have been 7 albums compiled from the various in-game soundtracks which will play in certain regions, story sequences, or open-world events. They are composed by Mihoyo’s<i>HOYO-MiX</i>team, lead by composer Yu-peng Chen. 
                More details can be found in the<a href="genshin/music.html">Music</a>page.
