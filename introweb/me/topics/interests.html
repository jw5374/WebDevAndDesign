                <p>Outside of school and work, there's not much to talk about.</p>
                <p>I'd like to put in breaks to demonstrate the section linking.</p>
                <p>Will be removed in the future obviously.</p>
                <p>The Game header does not work out. There's not really a use for sections given the brevity of the page.</p>
                <p>Still, I think it's generally a nice touch.</p>

                <p>Hey! Self-explanatory am I right? Wouldn't have any trouble with this assignment if I had any kind of social life</p>
                <p>The header includes a gif of one of my favorite series.</p>
                <p>Outside of animation, the source materials (light novels and manga) are also of interest. Generally you continue where the adaptations leave off</p>
                <p>Korean, and Chinese animation, comics, and novels are also growing in popularity.</p>

                <h2 id="gameHeader">Games</h2>
                <p>Recently have been playing a game called Genshin Impact. It's actually made a bit of a wave within the gaming community, however obviously unknown to anyone else.</p>
                <p>You can actually look at the favicon of <a href="../../index.html">Assignment 1</a> to see an emote that can be used within the game.</p>
                <p>If you have any interests in rhythm games, "<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh">osu!</a>" is very well made.</p>
