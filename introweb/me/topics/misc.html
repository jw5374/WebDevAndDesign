                <h1><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a></h1>
                <p>I use discord a fair amount (I always wonder why discord isn't being used over Slack honestly).</p>
                <p>I actually mod an unofficial NYU discord, although I'm not exactly active enough their unfortunately</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>Used to make the server icons, and I have an older animated one I made displayed here.</p>
                    <img src="../images/nyuAnimatedFlame.gif" alt="NYU discord old icon">
                    <p>I've used gimp and inkscape for making a few things before.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Is this class going to require Adobe products?</p>

                <h1>Languages</h1>
                <p>I can speak some rudimentary mandarin, and can speak a bit above rudimentary cantonese.</p>
                <p>So much has been lost unfortunately. Have taken some related classes for my language requirement and at least gained a bit of ability to now read it Chinese.</p>
                <p>Was born in Shanghai, and moved here before I turned 4.</p>
