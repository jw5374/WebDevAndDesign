        <p>
            Wanted to make a gif, but also included nongif with 5 layers to appease the assignment. <br />
            No greenscreen so much harder to key out things perfectly. <br />
            Wanted to be further in the background but couldn't find any suitable base images. <br />
            Base image was fairly low res, and this is further exacerbated by the height width requirements. <br />
            AND THE IMAGES ARE SLIGHTLY UNDER 800X600 SO THEY CAN ALIGN NEXT TO EACH OTHER. (seriously going to take points off again?)
